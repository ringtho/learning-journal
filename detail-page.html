                <p class="post-content">After several months of learning in the 
                    Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made 
                    the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get 
                    expert code reviews of my Solo Projects 
                    projects and meet like-minded peers.

                <p class="post-subheading">How I stay committed to learning</p>
                <p class="post-description">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to 
                    spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple 
                    projects using what I learned or work new techniques into 
                    existing projects.
                </p>
                <p class="post-description">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
                    share what I was learning and most things about my 
                    journey with the world.
                </p>
                <p class="post-subheading">How I got started</p>
                <p class="post-description">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                    I would take notes about what I was learning. After each 
                    learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on 
                    what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                    learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p class="post-description">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized 
                    that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
                    others learn and stay motivated.
